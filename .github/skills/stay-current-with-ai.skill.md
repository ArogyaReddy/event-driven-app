## Information Filters

### What to Prioritize
✅ Official release notes (GitHub, VS Code)
✅ Hands-on tutorials and demos
✅ Breaking changes and migrations
✅ New features with practical use
✅ Community best practices
✅ Performance improvements

### What to Skip
❌ Hype without substance
❌ Theoretical papers (unless researching)
❌ Duplicate news (same story, multiple sources)
❌ Tool wars and comparisons
❌ Features not relevant to your stack

## Learning System

### 1. Capture
Use a simple note system:
```
Date: 2026-01-12
Source: GitHub Changelog
Topic: New Copilot Agent Features
Status: To Try

Notes:
- Agents can now access MCP servers
- New @workspace indexing improvements
- Better context window management

Action: Try building agent with MCP
```

### 2. Process (Weekly)
Review notes and categorize:
- **Now**: Urgent, affects current work
- **Next**: Important, schedule time
- **Later**: Interesting, reference later
- **Archive**: Good to know, no action

### 3. Practice (Immediately)
Don't just read, DO:
```
Learn about feature → 
  Test in sandbox → 
    Apply to project → 
      Share learning →
        Teach others
```

### 4. Share (Weekly)
- Tweet about new feature
- Create example agent
- Update your workflows
- Help someone else learn

## Tools for Staying Current

## Warning Signs You're Falling Behind

🚨 Haven't tried a new Copilot feature in 2+ weeks
🚨 Don't understand latest changelog updates
🚨 Your workflows haven't evolved in a month
🚨 Community discusses features you don't know
🚨 New developers know techniques you don't

## Recovery Plan

If you fall behind:
```
Week 1: STOP
- Pause new learning
- Review last 4 weeks of updates
- Make list of what matters

Week 2: FOCUS
- Pick top 3 important updates
- Deep dive only those
- Ignore everything else

Week 3: PRACTICE
- Build with new knowledge
- Update workflows
- Test in real projects

Week 4: RESUME
- Return to normal schedule
- Don't try to catch up on everything
- Stay current from this point
```

## The Meta Skill

The most important skill is **learning to learn faster**:
```
1. Identify what's important (signal vs noise)
2. Learn just enough to apply
3. Apply immediately to real work
4. Reflect on what worked
5. Share to reinforce
6. Repeat daily
```

Remember: In AI, staying current isn't about knowing everything—it's about knowing what matters, learning it quickly, and applying it effectively. Focus on fundamentals, practice daily, and teach others.
