@arog - now the real implementation and actual usecase.
this repo is : AROG
Our goal is : Use AROG repo [@arog agent] in other repos, in ORG level for any of the projects and teams and get the most of @arog for everything.
So, we need to replicate that actual usage, the actual implementation.

SO, let's do as follows.
#1. Have a PROJECT with React, TypeScript, NodeJS, APIs, UI, Full-Stack App, event driven acrchitecture, like a real time UI based app, modern and professional use.
#2. Use our @arog in it for everyting [how do we use?? thats the point for us to proove and implement]
#3. Use @arog for coding, reviews, code reviews, unit testing, UI testing, automation testing, API testing, code reviews, perfromance testing, security testing, code quality, code analysis, accesbility tests..
#4. Make sure our @arog=EEVERYTHING in the repo, in the project, in the ORG
#5. @arog is agent to chat, agent to answer, agent to help, agent to code, agent to do EVERYTHING
