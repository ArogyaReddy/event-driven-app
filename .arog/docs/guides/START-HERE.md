## 🚨 Common Pitfalls (Avoid These)

❌ **Learning without doing** - Build projects, don't just read
❌ **Trying to learn everything** - Focus on what matters
❌ **Not practicing daily** - Consistency beats intensity
❌ **Working alone** - Join communities, share, teach
❌ **Ignoring fundamentals** - Master basics before advanced
❌ **Not measuring progress** - Track and celebrate wins

✅ **Do this instead**:
- Build something every day
- Focus on one skill at a time
- Practice for 30-60 min daily
- Share your learning journey
- Master fundamentals first
- Use the dashboard to track
